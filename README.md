# Resume
Everytime I'm asked for my resume I need to go through Documents, Downloads, Drive and two different email accounts just to find a really outdated version of it. 

Tired, really tired of it, this is my first attempt of having an up to date resume online. 

**What do I want to do in this repo?**

* Having a web page with my most recent resume
* Host the web page on GitHub pages (I think I've never used it, so it might worth the try)
* Create a way to download the resume with a not-so-bad format from the page
* Remember the little-to-none front-end development knowledge I swear I had on college
